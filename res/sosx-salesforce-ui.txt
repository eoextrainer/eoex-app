refactor the app to reflect the structure, layout and design of the salesforce platoform.

start with a unified tab-based architecture where each module is presented as tabs, as showed in the url: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/page/home


in the top left corner show the EOEX log and below create a hamburger menu with the list of sosx apps, namely [crm, erp, studio, service]. this menu displays a collapsable dropdown menu with the list of modules inside each app and once clicked then the app dynamically opens the selected module at the selected module tab.

here is the tab structure of each app:
    CRM
        dashboard | campaigns | leads | opportunities | accounts | contacts | tasks | reports | calendar (sales forecast calendar)
    STUDIO
        dashboard | campaigns | leads | calendar (editorial) | message editor | contents scheduler
    ERP
        dashboard | asset manager | finances | hr | strategies | QA & Risk | calendar (business operations planner)
    SERVICE
        dashboard | high SLA tickets | mid SLA tickets | low SLA tickets | calendar

in the top right corner create an elegant subtle menu with: notification bell | setup | login


create the following users:
    - system admin: can see everything in the app and impersonate any user for testing
    - manager: user level commumity leader with elevated privilges, oversight on group member features, results and KPIs
        1x CRM manager
        1x Studio manager
        1x ERP manager
        1x Services manager

    - users: community users grouped by team with limited access only to features, components and modules assigned to them
        - CRM users:
            1x business development user
            1x sales account manager user
        - Studio users:
            1x marketing manager user
            1x digital marketing user
            1x marketing campaign manager
        - ERP users:
            1x HR manager
            1x accounting and finance manager
            1x resource planning managger
            1x ceo user
        - Services users:
            1x level 1 support engineer
            1x level 2 support engineer
            1x level 3 support engineer
all of the users must have the same password and there must be a pop-up login page with a collapsable card that elegantly displays each user credentials for testing


fully implement the above criteria.
fully test the entire application and ensure that each user credential works flawlessly
check all of the ports currently used by the application
restart the application
launch the app on the local browser
