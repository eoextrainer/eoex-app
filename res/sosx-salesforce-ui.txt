refactor the app to reflect the structure, layout and design of the salesforce platoform.

start with a unified tab-based architecture where each module is presented as tabs, as showed in the url: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/page/home


in the top left corner show the EOEX log and below create a hamburger menu with the list of sosx apps, namely [crm, erp, studio, service]. this menu displays a collapsable dropdown menu with the list of modules inside each app and once clicked then the app dynamically opens the selected module at the selected module tab.

here is the tab structure of each app:
    CRM
        dashboard | campaigns | leads | opportunities | accounts | contacts | tasks | reports | calendar (sales forecast calendar)
    STUDIO
        dashboard | campaigns | leads | calendar (editorial) | message editor | contents scheduler
    ERP
        dashboard | asset manager | finances | hr | strategies | QA & Risk | calendar (business operations planner)
    SERVICE
        dashboard | high SLA tickets | mid SLA tickets | low SLA tickets | calendar

in the top right corner create an elegant subtle menu with: notification bell | setup | login


create the following users:
    - system admin: can see everything in the app and impersonate any user for testing
    - manager: user level commumity leader with elevated privilges, oversight on group member features, results and KPIs
        1x CRM manager
        1x Studio manager
        1x ERP manager
        1x Services manager

    - users: community users grouped by team with limited access only to features, components and modules assigned to them
        - CRM users:
            1x business development user
            1x sales account manager user
        - Studio users:
            1x marketing manager user
            1x digital marketing user
            1x marketing campaign manager
        - ERP users:
            1x HR manager
            1x accounting and finance manager
            1x resource planning managger
            1x ceo user
        - Services users:
            1x level 1 support engineer
            1x level 2 support engineer
            1x level 3 support engineer
all of the users must have the same password and there must be a pop-up login page with a collapsable card that elegantly displays each user credentials for testing


fully implement the above criteria.
fully test the entire application and ensure that each user credential works flawlessly
check and free all of the ports currently used by the application
restart the application
launch the app on the local browser







inside each app module (tab) you must group the services by cards containing features by grouping
example:
    CRM
        dashboard
            copy the dashboard tiles in url: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/page/home
        campaigns
            shows a list view of campaigns like url: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Campaign/list?filterName=AllActiveCampaigns
                one campaign view must be built and organised exactly like url: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Campaign/701J9000000tSykIAE/view
        leads
            shows the leads list view like in url: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Lead/pipelineInspection?filterName=00BJ9000004g5nTMAQ
                one lead view must be like url: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Lead/00QJ90000034SszMAE/view
        opportunities
            shows the opportunities list view like url: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Opportunity/list?filterName=AllOpportunities
                one opportunity view must be like: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/006J900000BapCsIAJ/view
        accounts
            shows the accounts list view as in url: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Account/list?filterName=AllAccounts
                one account view must be like: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/001J900000MQPDIIA5/view
        contacts
            shows the contacts list view like: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Contact/pipelineInspection?filterName=00BJ9000004g5nYMAQ
                one contact view must be like url: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Contact/003J900000KYHGLIA5/view
        tasks
            shows tasks list views like url: https://curious-goat-24lain-dev-ed.trailblaze.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Task/list?filterName=OpenTasks
        reports
        calendar (sales forecast calendar)
            show a card based year calendar (2026) with entries for for the relevant calendar entries (here for a CRM)


Repeat this format for the ERP, the Studio and the Services


this the is matrix of access and visibility by user:

    - CRM users: only the relevant users can see this tab, its components and its contents, for the other users this part must be invisible
            1x business development user
            1x sales account manager user
        - Studio users: only the relevant users can see this tab, its components and its contents, for the other users this part must be invisible
            1x marketing manager user
            1x digital marketing user
            1x marketing campaign manager
        - ERP users: only the relevant users can see this tab, its components and its contents, for the other users this part must be invisible
            1x HR manager
            1x accounting and finance manager
            1x resource planning managger
            1x ceo user
        - Services users: only the relevant users can see this tab, its components and its contents, for the other users this part must be invisible
            1x level 1 support engineer
            1x level 2 support engineer
            1x level 3 support engineer
        - Admin Portal: only the relevant users can see this tab, its components and its contents, for the other users this part must be invisible

fully implement the above criteria.
fully test the entire application and ensure that each user credential works flawlessly
check and free all of the ports currently used by the application
restart the application
launch the app on the local browser
